# Gaby Learns Python
Hey Gaby! This repo is to store the lessons for each of the concepts we are going to talk about. It's basically our home base for tracking everything you learn as you dive into Python.

## What's inside?
### Lesson
This is where the actual teaching happens.
*   **day1.ipynb**: The absolute basics. We talk about variables (think of them as labeled boxes for data), simple math, and your very first functions.
*   **day2.ipynb**: A deeper dive into data types (Strings, Ints, Floats, Booleans, and Lists) and how functions are actually put together.
*   **day3.ipynb**: Learning about **Operators** (math, comparison, and logical) and **Conditionals** (if, elif, else). How your code makes decisions.
*   **day4.ipynb**: Understanding **Scopes**. We talk about Local vs. Global variables using the "Car" analogy and the "L.E.G.B." rule.
*   **day5.ipynb**: Learning about **Loops**. Covers For loops, While loops, and how to use Break and Continue to control them.
*   **day6.ipynb**: Learning about **Error Handling**. Covers Try, Except, Else, Finally, and how to raise your own errors.
*   **day7.ipynb**: Learning about **Classes** (blueprints for objects) and **Inheritance** (how classes can "borrow" traits from each other).
*   **day8.ipynb**: Learning about **Common Methods**. Covers useful tools for working with Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, and Type Conversion.
*   **day9.ipynb**: Learning about **File I/O**. Covers how to read, write, and append data to files, as well as using the "with" statement.
*   **day10.ipynb**: Learning about **Modules and Packages**. Covers importing, `if __name__ == "__main__"`, pip, and creating your own modules.
*   **day11.ipynb**: Learning about **List Comprehensions**. One-line list/dict/set creation with filtering and transformation.
*   **day12.ipynb**: **Advanced Dictionaries and Sets**. `defaultdict`, `Counter`, set operations, and dict merging.
*   **day13.ipynb**: **Advanced Functions**. `*args`, `**kwargs`, lambda, `map()`, `filter()`, docstrings, and type hints.
*   **day14.ipynb**: **Working with Text**. f-strings, `.join()`, `.split()`, `.strip()`, regex basics, and string checking methods.
*   **day15.ipynb**: **Working with Numbers**. `math`, `random`, `statistics` modules, rounding, and precision.
*   **day16.ipynb**: **Dates and Time**. `datetime`, `strftime`, `strptime`, `timedelta`, and date arithmetic.
*   **day17.ipynb**: **Working with Data (CSV and JSON)**. Reading/writing CSV and JSON, building a mini data pipeline.
*   **day18.ipynb**: **Thinking in Arrays**. The vectorized mindset, `zip()`, column-based thinking, preparing for pandas.
*   **day19.ipynb**: **Building a Data Pipeline**. Extract-Transform-Analyze-Output pattern, modular design, error handling, testing.
*   **day20.ipynb**: **Introduction to Pandas**. DataFrames, Series, filtering, grouping, and reading data in one line.
### Practice (Rustlings-style)
This is a self-checking practice system inspired by [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

Each `Practice/Mod{N}.py` file looks like a real project module with `# TODO` markers and `raise NotImplementedError()` stubs. Replace them with your code and run the checker:

```bash
pylings            # Auto-watch the next incomplete exercise
pylings next       # Run the next incomplete exercise
pylings list       # Show progress on all exercises
pylings watch      # Watch mode — auto re-runs on save, 'q' to quit, 'h' for hints
pylings 3          # Run a specific module
```

When all checks pass, remove the `# I AM NOT DONE` line from the file to mark it complete.

Running `pylings` with no arguments automatically starts watch mode on the next
incomplete exercise. Syntax errors are caught early and displayed cleanly before
any tests run.

### Assignments
This is where you get to put your skills to the test!
*   **assignment1.py**: The "Cupcake Counter" challenge. You'll use variables and functions to help a bakery manage its flour supply.
*   **assignment2.py**: The "Bakery's Price Check" challenge. You'll use operators and conditionals to validate and flag orders.
*   **assignment3.py**: The "Bakery Gets Bigger" challenge. You'll create a system to manage baked goods using **Classes** and **Inheritance**.
*   **assignment4.py**: The "Bakery's Busy Day" challenge. You'll process a list of orders and track flour usage using **Loops** and **Global Scopes**.
*   **assignment5.py**: The "Bakery's Recipe Module" challenge. You'll organize recipes into a module with **functions and dicts**.
*   **assignment6.py**: The "Bakery's Menu Board" challenge. You'll transform menu data using **list/dict/set comprehensions**.
*   **assignment7.py**: The "Bakery's Price Calculator" challenge. You'll build a pricing system with **advanced functions, lambdas, and closures**.
*   **assignment8.py**: The "Bakery's Delivery Schedule" challenge. You'll track deliveries using **dates, times, and timedeltas**.
*   **assignment9.py**: The "Bakery's Sales Report" challenge. You'll read CSV data and export a report as **JSON**.
*   **assignment10.py**: The "Bakery's Data Dashboard" (Capstone). You'll combine everything into a **full data pipeline** with reporting.

### Gradebook
You can track your progress and see your grades for each assignment in the [Gradebook](Assignments/README.md). This is where you'll find feedback on what you've mastered and what might need a little more practice!

## How to navigate
1.  **Start with the Lessons**: Open up the `Lesson/` folder and go through the files in order (`day1.ipynb`, `day2.ipynb`, etc.). Read the comments, they're there to help explain what's going on!
2.  **Try the Assignments**: Once you feel good about a lesson, check out the `Assignments/` folder to practice what you've learned.
3.  **Run the pylings**: Use the `pylings` command to practice with auto-graded exercises.
4.  **Run the code**: You can open the lesson notebooks in VS Code or Jupyter. For assignments, you can run them in your terminal using `python3 Assignments/assignment1.py` (or whichever assignment you're working on).
